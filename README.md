Brioche is a bioinformatics pipeline for mapping markers to a given reference genome. brioche uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/), a domain-specific language (DSL) for defining
workflows, as its workflow management tool. Brioche streamlines marker mapping to reference genomes through a Nextflow-powered pipeline.

Brioche is funded as part of the Australian Grains Genebank Strategic Partnership, a $30M joint investment between the Victorian State Government and Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) that aims to unlock the genetic potential of plant genetic resources for the benefit of the Australian grain growers.


**Key features:**
- Efficient workflow management: Nextflow, a domain-specific language designed for workflows, orchestrates processing steps with clarity and precision.
- Formalized process definition: Each step, from input to output, is clearly defined within the pipeline, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
- Automated job submission and connection: Nextflow seamlessly handles job execution and data flow between steps, freeing you from manual task management.
